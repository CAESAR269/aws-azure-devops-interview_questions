# AWS Interview Questions & Answers


#### 1. Compare AWS with OpenStack

**Answer.** OpenStack and AWS help to upload images in which AWS has EC2, and EMR Hadoop based big data. On the other hand OpenStack is designed to scale on hardware without specific requirements.

#### 2. How will you access the data on EBS in AWS ?

#### 4. Differentiate between vertical and horizontal scaling in AWS.

**Answer. Horizontal scaling**, also known as scaling out, involves adding more machines to a network or system to distribute the load across multiple devices.

Instead of increasing the power of a single machine (as in vertical scaling), horizontal scaling adds more machines to handle the increased load. Each machine operates independently, and the workload is distributed among them.

**Vertical scaling**, also known as scaling up, involves increasing the power of a single machine, such as upgrading the CPU, adding more RAM, or expanding storage capacity.

In vertical scaling, the resources of a single machine are increased to handle a higher load. This could involve upgrading the hardware components or adjusting the configurations of the existing machine.
