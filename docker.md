# Docker Interview Questions & Answers

#### 1. Docker container will get reboot failure what you will do if it won't work ?
**Answer.** If a Docker container faces reboot failure, I would first investigate the container logs using the docker logs command to identify any error messages or issues. I might also check the container's configuration and dependencies. If the problem persists, I may try restarting the Docker daemon, updating Docker, or recreating the container with proper configurations. If all else fails, I may need to troubleshoot the underlying host system or consult Docker community forums for assistance.
